## Astronaut Reaction Times Game

Things happen quickly when youâ€™re travelling at 16,000 miles per hour (around
7,000 metres per second), and when debris and [micrometeoroids](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Space_Environment/Micro-meteoroid_introduction) are heading towards you at around 22,500 miles per hour. Quick reactions and a steady
hand are also needed for tasks requiring fine motor skills, such as controlling robotic arms.
Astronauts are trained intensively to speed up their reactions to incidents, and
to prepare them for all eventualities. 

[NASA scientists have conducted experiments to test astronaut reaction times.](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/7.html)
Astronauts were first tested using a computer system on the ground, then
again when they were on board the ISS, and once more when they returned. It
was found their reaction times more than doubled in space. Scientists suggest
that stress, as well as the brain having to adapt to microgravity, could be the
cause of this, and that normal performance was found soon after returning to Earth. 

You can learn more about what it is like to be an astronaut, and more about Tim Peake's mission, on [the UK National STEM Centre website here](http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/timpeake).

Let's create a game in Scratch to test your reaction skills, and those of your friends and family, to see if you could become an astronaut like Tim Peake.
