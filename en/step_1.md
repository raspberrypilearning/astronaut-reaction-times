## What you will make
In this activity, you will learn about Astronaut reaction times, and distances travelled by the International Space Station in that time, by creating a reaction time game in Scratch.

For the first time ever, a British astronaut from the European Space Agency is going to live and work on the International Space Station. British ESA Astronaut Tim Peake is going to orbit the earth for half a year. But what is it like to live and work in space? 

You can learn more about what it is like to be an astronaut and more about Tim Peake's mission on [the UK National STEM Centre website here](http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/timpeake).

## What you will learn
By creating a Scratch reaction game you will learn:

- Why astronauts need to have super-sharp reactions in space, and the average distance travelled by the ISS.  
- How to import images into Scratch and use them as backgrounds and sprites.
- How to store data like time and distance in variables.
- Use multiplying operators to calculate distance travelled by the ISS.
