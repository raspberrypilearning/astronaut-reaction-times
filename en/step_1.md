## Introduction
You are going to use Scatch to create a game that will test your reaction times and work out how far the International Space Station travels in the time it takes you to react.

### What you will make
<div class="scratch-preview">

You can learn more about what it is like to be an astronaut and more about Tim Peake's mission on [the UK National STEM Centre website here](http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/timpeake).

## What you will learn
By creating a Scratch reaction game you will learn:

- Why astronauts need to have super-sharp reactions in space, and the average distance travelled by the ISS.  
- How to import images into Scratch and use them as backgrounds and sprites.
- How to store data like time and distance in variables.
- Use multiplying operators to calculate distance travelled by the ISS.

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):
