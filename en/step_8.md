## What next?

- You could make the game more interactive by getting the Tim Peake sprite to ask for the player's name before they start and storing that information in a new `name` variable. Then you would be able to personalise the `say` blocks to include the player's name.
- Using some of the other images, could you change the background and sprites to make the game more interesting?
- If you have a [Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/), could you use it to trigger the timer instead of pressing the space bar?
