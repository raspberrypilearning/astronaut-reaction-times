## Create variables to store data

- To create a variable, click on `Variables` in the blocks palette and then click `Make a Variable`. The New Variable window opens and asks you to type a name for your variable.
- Name the first variable `time` and ensure that `For all sprites` is checked before clicking **OK**.
	A variable holds a value that can be changed. The time variable you have created is an example of a value that can be changed and used inside different scripts. You will use it to store the reaction times of players. 
- Youâ€™ll see some orange blocks are added to your `Variable` area called `time`, and a small counter box will appear on the stage.
