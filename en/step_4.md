## Set the stage with a space theme

- If you are using a Raspberry Pi you can open Scratch by clicking on **Menu** and **Programming**, followed by **Scratch**. Alternatively, you can use Scratch 2.0 online for this activity although some of the blocks may be slightly different. 
- Create a new file by selecting **File** and **New**.
- Delete the Scratch Cat sprite by right-clicking on it and selecting **Delete** from the menu that is displayed.
- For this project, you need a space-themed background and an Astronaut sprite. To add a background in Scratch, click on `stage` in the sprites palette and then click on `Backgrounds` next to the `scripts` tab.
- Click on `Paint` to draw your own background or `import` to use the same images as this resource. 
	Connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet, and download this [Space background](files/Space-background.png) and British ESA astronaut [Tim Peake sprite](files/Astronaut-Tim.png). Save them somewhere that you will be able to find them on your Raspberry Pi. You can also find more images to use [here](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/astronaut-reaction-times/tree/master/files) if you do not like those.
- Next, add a new sprite by clicking on the `import a new sprite` icon on the sprites palette (which looks like the image below), selecting `Astronaut-Tim` from the choices and clicking **OK**.

- Save your Scratch project work by clicking on **File** and **Save As**. Name your progam **Astronaut Reaction Game** and save it in your home directory or some place that you can find it later.
