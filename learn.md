By creating a Scratch reaction game you will learn:

- Why astronauts need to have super-sharp reactions in space, and the average distance travelled by the ISS.  
- How to import images into Scratch and use them as backgrounds and sprites.
- How to store data like time and distance in variables.
- Use multiplying operators to calculate distance travelled by the ISS.

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator)
- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
